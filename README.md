# Spring-Boot-React-App


This project is a web application built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. The Spring Boot API handles business logic, while the React app provides an interactive UI. To run, start the backend with `mvn spring-boot:run` and the frontend with `npm start`.
